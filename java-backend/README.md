# Finance app

A aggregator for financial data on the web. It will be a web app that allows users to search for financial data, such as stock prices, company information, and news articles. The app will use various APIs to gather data from different sources and present it in a user-friendly interface.

The service will be designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new data sources and features. 

Later I hope to integrate machine learning models to provide insights and predictions based on the data collected. As a first step, I will focus on building the core functionality of the app, including the ability to search for financial data and display it in a user-friendly way. Then I will integrate Spark to handle large datasets and perform complex queries. and finally, I will add machine learning models to provide insights and predictions based on the data collected.

The application will be built using Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and will serve data through a REST API.
